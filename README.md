# Data collection for human-human and human-robot handover tasks

This software was developped during a group project, it's aim is to collect and synchronize data coming from different source during a human-human handover task. The equipment includes:

2. kinect
3. inertial sensor embedded in smartwatches

## Installation

For what regards packages "mocap_optitrack", "syn" and "wearable_client" is sufficient to copy them in a catkin workespace and compile them using catkin_make. While for "openni_tracker" before you could compile it you have to install openNi library (you can find installation instruction here https://github.com/OpenNI/OpenNI).

All the ROS package were developed for ROS Indigo.

To install the android applications you have to use Android Studio.
